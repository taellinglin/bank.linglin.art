A vibrant circular emblem featuring adorable anime characters with sparkling eyes, set in a whimsical Chinese DMT × Ghibli landscape. Cute pagodas, misty mountains, playful foxes, and friendly dragons dance among floating sakura blossoms and lotus flowers. Soft pastel colors—pinks, blues, mint greens—blend with golden highlights in a harmonious, hand-drawn oekaki style. Every detail feels dreamy, playful, and meticulously crafted, like a magical portal to a kawaii East Asian wonderland.
